# MasterThesis

This repository contains all supporting material, data processing, and visualization code used in the master's thesis “The Role of Digitalization in the Decarbonization of EU EU Industries”.

- AI_Impact.ipynb:
Contains the code to visualize the energy and CO2 reduction potential of AI across modeled scenarios.

- Digital Twins_Impact.ipynb:
Contains the code to visualize the energy and CO2 reduction potential of digital twins across modeled scenarios.

- IoT_Impact.ipynb:
Contains the code to visualize the energy and CO2 reduction potential of IoT across modeled scenarios.

- Automation & Robotics_Impact.ipynb:
Contains the code to visualize the energy and CO2 reduction potential of Automation & Robotics across modeled scenarios.

- NGFS Baseline.ipynb:
Visualizes the baseline industrial energy demand and emissions as defined by selected NGFS climate scenarios, forming the foundation for comparisons.

- Scenarios Adoption curves.ipynb:
Includes the curve fitting and visualization logic for the adoption of the digitalization levers across the three modeled scenarios (BAU, EDCE, TTT).

- ExcelFramework_Analysis_MasterThesis_Impact.xlsx:
The central modeling file: it hosts the full scenario logic, numerical assumptions, input parameters and serves as the backend for the code notebooks.

- Industry_Analysis_1-JRC-IDEES-2021_Industry.xlsx:
Provides data on energy consumption and CO2 emissions for EU ETS industry sectors. Used to build the cluster logic and scenario weighting.
